> Comparing javascript/client side libraries and javascript 

Choosing frontend framework can be a tiresome task


We can't try out every js framework available out there, so while choosing right framework for your next project, research which framework solves the core need of your project for example if your project needs graph templates ,you might go for d3.js and **Most common factor comes into play is what framework you are familiar with**


While there is no wisdom in rewriting whole application if something better comes up, But if you are starting a new project , there is no harm in researching and trying a better option


While it is not possible to cover every factor, we have tried to cover most concerning frontend technology, Any additions/updations are highly encouraged


We have tried to keep points generalized, otherwise, after all its all javascript and everything is possible.
