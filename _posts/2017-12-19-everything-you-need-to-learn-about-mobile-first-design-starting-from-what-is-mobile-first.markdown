While learning more about mobile first, it seemed to me that responsive design itself mean mobile first.

In simple words, mobile first is adding media queries to expand the content, rather than adding media queries to shrink the content.

There is already much written on mobile first( term originally coined by [Luke Wroblewski](http://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first)), So I am just gonna throw links at you.
